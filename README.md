# Handwriting Recognition System

This repository is the Tensorflow implementation of the Handwriting Recognition System described in [Handwriting Recognition of Historical Documents with Few Labeled Data](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/325993975_Handwriting_Recognition_of_Historical_Documents_with_Few_Labeled_Data). Please cite the paper if you use this code in your research paper.

This code is free for academic and research use. For commercial use of the code please contact [Edgard Chammas](mailto:contact@edgard.net).

To help run the system, sample images from [ICDAR2017 Competition on Handwritten Text Recognition on the READ Dataset](https://scriptnet.iit.demokritos.gr/competitions/8/) are added.

## Configuration
General configuration can be found in config.py

CNN-specific architecture configuration can be found in cnn.py

## Training
```
python train.py
```
This will generate a text log file and a Tensorflow summary.

## Decoding
```
python test.py
```
This will generate, for each image, the line transcription. The output will be written to decoded.txt by default.

```
python compute_probs.py
```
This will generate, for each image, the posterior probabilities at each timestep. Files will be stored in Probs by default.

## Dependencies
- Tensorflow
- OpenCV-Python
